# Sorting
This program is for learning five sorting algorithms. 1) Bubble Sort, 2) Merge Sort, 3) Radix Sort, 4) Heap Sort, and 5) Quick Sort.

Quick Note:
1) All five sorters will receive integers.
2) All sorts will be ascending orders.
3) Quick Sort will have a partition selection which was hard-coded but also could be adjustable by users.

This program is one of school assignments using Java.
